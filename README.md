This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: using an uninitialized state variable. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where we attempt to access the state before it's been set.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version, showcasing the use of optional chaining or a conditional check to handle the case where the state might still be undefined.
